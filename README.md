Noita Minus mod for Noita.

# Features

* NOTE: In most cases of "larger" and "smaller", the change is a factor of 3/5 (for smaller) or 5/3 (for larger). This might change.

- [x] Smaller biome sizes
- [x] Less starting HP
- [x] Orb and health ups add less max HP
- [x] Lower prices in shops
- [x] Higher wand, HP-up, chest, flask spawn rates
- [x] Increase movement speed and acceleration somewhat (currently 30%)
- [x] Drain dark cave
- [x] Move worm egg closer to spawn
- [x] Make biomes one-way
    - The layout of most biomes is now much more linear. The most immediately noticeable change is the layout of mines; the lava lake is completely gone on the right and the orb room is moved beyond the twisty passages. 
- [x] Put temple portals under most biomes (twisty passages and fungal caverns being the most noticeable examples)
- [ ] Re-add interesting deleted biomes, i.e. temple

# TODO/bugs

make biome sizes smaller due to one-way nature? atm you have to traverse through the same or more amount of level to get to fungal/dcave/...

Fix spawn rates further for more biomes via adding to wang_tiles; this has been done for fungal but there are more biomes w/ capped wand/potion spawn rates.
