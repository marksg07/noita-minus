# TODO/bugs

make biome sizes smaller due to one-way nature? atm you have to traverse through the same or more amount of level to get to fungal/dcave/...

orbs don't work, healthups might?

possibly fix spawn rates; add more spawn points to wand-rich biomes like fungal?

dark cave drainage not working

some teleports broken; from jungle to temple and from boss to death room
